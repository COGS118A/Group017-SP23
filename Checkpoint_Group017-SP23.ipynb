    "# Abstract \n",
    "The goal of this project is to use a set of factors about the houses in a neighborhood to predict median house value within that neighborhood. We intend for this to be a regression task, with the data we use containing such variables as latitude/longitude, the population of a block of houses, the number of households within a block, and more. We plan to conduct model selection across several different model types (linear regression, kNN, random forest, decision trees) so as to optimize for minimum error, after which we will test the final and best model and see how accurately it can predict pricing. Accuracy will be measured via metrics like mean absolute error."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction of house prices in a certain area is a well researched topic in the field of Machine Learning. There have been several instances of research conducted to develop accurate models using various datasets. The dataset we used is the California House Prices dataset available on Kaggle, which provides information taken from the 1990 CA Census about housing features and corresponding prices in different neighborhoods of California. There have been studies that have utilized similar datasets to try to model the relationship between house attributes and their prices, employing various machine learning algorithms such as regression, random forests, and SVMs.<a name=\"huang\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#huangnote),<a name=\"manasa\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#manasanote)\n",
    "\n",
    "These studies have tried to create accurate models that can estimate house prices based on a variety of features. Researchers have aimed to provide insights using these models for not only homebuyers, but also sellers and real estate professionals, helping them in making informed decisions regarding housing investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The California housing dataset that our project is using is a modified version of the California Housing dataset, initially featured in a paper by Pace, R. Kelley, and Ronald Barry about simultaneous autoregressions.<a name=\"pace\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#pacenote)"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for housing is a tricky thing throughout the state of California, as we as UCSD students well know; there are a preponderance of factors (the most important of which is *price*) that determine whether a home in a given location is a good fit for a resident. House price is a key factor in many decisions on both ends of the spectrum: the areas a potential buyer looks at when house hunting depends largely on what house price tends to be in those areas, or current homeowners planning to move out may hesitate to sell their home until they can have a good estimate of how much they'll get for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to use various given factors about the houses in a given California neighborhood to predict (via several ML models such as linear regression, k nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests) the neighborhood's median house value, providing people with a numerically analyzable measure of central tendency that could sway them in their real estate decisions. In other words, our project will be able to answer the question of: given such variables as median house age, number of rooms, and median income within a block of houses, can we predict what the median house price of a house in that block/neighborhood would be? \n"
