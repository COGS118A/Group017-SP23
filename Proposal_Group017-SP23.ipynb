    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for housing is a tricky thing throughout the state of California, as we as UCSD students well know; there are a preponderance of factors (the most important of which is *price*) that determine whether a home in a given location is a good fit for a resident. House price is a key factor in many decisions on both ends of the spectrum: the areas a potential buyer looks at when house hunting depends largely on what house price tends to be in those areas, or current homeowners planning to move out may hesitate to sell their home until they can have a good estimate of how much they'll get for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to use various given factors about the houses in a given California neighborhood to predict (via several ML models such as linear regression, k nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests) the neighborhood's median house value, providing people with a numerically analyzable measure of central tendency that could sway them in their real estate decisions. In other words, our project will be able to answer the question of: given such variables as median house age, number of rooms, and median income within a block of houses, can we predict what the median house price of a house in that block/neighborhood would be? \n"
